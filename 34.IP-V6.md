## **1. What is an IPv6 address?**

An **IPv6 address** is a **unique 128-bit number** assigned to every device on a network to **identify it** and allow it to communicate with other devices.

* IPv6 uses **128 bits** → divided into **8 groups of 16 bits** called **hextets**.
* Each hextet is written in **hexadecimal** (0–9, a–f).
* Format: `X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X` → for example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

## **2. IPv6 Address Structure**

An IPv6 address has **two main parts**:

1. **Network prefix** → identifies the network the device is on.
2. **Interface ID** → identifies the device within that network.

Example:

```
IPv6 address: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Prefix length: /64
```

* Network prefix: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000` → same for all devices in the network.
* Interface ID: `0000:8a2e:0370:7334` → unique device identifier.

**Prefix length** (`/64`) tells the device which part is network and which part is host.

## **3. Technical Example (with real IPv6 addresses)**

Let’s say you are in an office with IPv6:

| Device  | IPv6 Address                            | Prefix Length |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Laptop  | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:0001 | /64           |
| Desktop | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:0002 | /64           |
| Printer | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:0010 | /64           |
| Router  | 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:000f | /64           |

* All devices share `2001:0db8:85a3:0000` → same network.
* Interface ID differs → `0001, 0002, 0010, 000f` → unique device identifiers.

### Example Communication

If your laptop `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:0001` wants to send data to the printer `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:0010`:

1. It checks the prefix `/64`.
2. Determines the printer is in the **same network**.
3. Sends the data directly via the router/switch inside the network.

### Conclusion

* IPv6 range: `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0` → `ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`.
* Total addresses: 2¹²⁸ ≈ 3.4 × 10³⁸ → huge number, enough for every device on Earth multiple times.
* ✅ Example of global unicast IPv6: `2001:4860:4860::8888` (Google DNS).
* ✅ Example of link-local IPv6: `fe80::1ff:fe23:4567:890a` (used inside networks).
