## 🧩 Parts of an HTTP Response (Very Simple)

### **1️⃣ HTTP Status Code – “What happened?”**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

👉 Tells if your request was:

* Successful
* Failed
* Redirected

🧠 Like saying:

> “Yes, I understood your request 👍”

Example:

* **200** → Success
* **404** → Not found
* **500** → Server error

### **2️⃣ Response Headers – “Extra details from server”**

```
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 3050
```

👉 Tells:

* What type of data is coming
* How big it is
* How to handle it

🧠 Like saying:

> “I’m sending you an HTML page”

---

### **3️⃣ Response Body (Optional) – “Actual data”**

```
<html>
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
</html>
```

👉 This is the **real content**

* Webpage HTML
* JSON data
* Image
* File

🧠 Like the **actual answer** to your question.
