# **Topic 13: How DNS Works – Super Simple**

## 🧒 Simple Meaning

**DNS = Internet’s Phone Book**
It translates **names → numbers** so computers can find each other.

```
www.example.com  →  192.168.1.1
```

## 🔄 Step-by-Step Flow (Simple Blocks)

```
[Browser/User] 
      |
      v
[Local DNS Cache] --(if IP found)--> Return IP
      |
      v (if not found)
[DNS Resolver / ISP]
      |
      v
[Root DNS Server]
      |
      v
[TLD DNS Server] (.com / .org)
      |
      v
[Authoritative DNS Server]
      |
      v
[IP Address Returned to Resolver]
      |
      v
[Resolver Returns IP to Browser]
      |
      v
[Browser Connects to Web Server]
```

## 🧱 Super Simple Real-Life Analogy

**You want to call your friend “Amma”:**

1. Check your **phone contacts** (Local DNS cache)
2. If not there, call **friend’s parent** (DNS resolver)
3. Parent asks **neighborhood directory** (Root DNS)
4. Directory points to **street directory** (TLD DNS)
5. Street directory gives **exact house number** (Authoritative DNS)
6. You call **Amma’s house** (Browser connects to Web Server)

---

## 🧪 Example

1. You type:

```
www.google.com
```

2. Browser checks **local cache** → Not found

3. Resolver asks:

   * Root DNS → TLD DNS → Authoritative DNS

4. Resolver gets:

```
142.250.195.46
```

5. Resolver sends IP to browser → Browser connects → Website loads ✅

## 🌐 One-Line Technical Understanding

> DNS works by recursively resolving domain names through a series of servers, ultimately returning the IP address so your computer can connect to the website.

---

## 🎯 Memory Trick

```
Browser → Cache → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → IP → Connect
```

## 🏗️ Tiny Block Diagram (Minimal)

```
Browser
  |
  v
Cache? -----> IP found? Yes -> Done
  |
  v No
Resolver -> Root -> TLD -> Authoritative -> IP -> Browser
```
