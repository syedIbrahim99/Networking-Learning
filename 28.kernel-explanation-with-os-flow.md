# 2️⃣ Flow Example – Opening a File

**Scenario:** You want to open `mydoc.txt` in VSCode.

```
YOU (User)
    ↓
[User Applications Layer] 
    • VSCode: "I want to open mydoc.txt"
    ↓
[GUI / Shell / Tools Layer]
    • Bash or Nautilus: "Let me help ask the system"
    ↓
[System Libraries / APIs Layer]
    • libc / system call: "Kernel, please open this file for me"
    ↓
[Kernel Layer]
    • Checks file permissions
    • Locates file on disk
    • Reads data into memory
    ↓
[Hardware Layer]
    • Disk provides file data
    • CPU & RAM process it
    ↓
[Kernel Layer]
    • Returns file data to Libraries
    ↓
[System Libraries / APIs Layer]
    • Passes data to GUI / Shell
    ↓
[GUI / Shell / Tools Layer]
    • Sends data to Application
    ↓
[User Applications Layer]
    • VSCode displays file
    ↓
YOU (User)
    • See the file content on screen
```

# 3️⃣ “Child-Friendly Story Version”

1. **You** say: “I want to see a file!”
2. **VSCode** (Application Layer) says: “Got it, I’ll ask the helpers.”
3. **GUI / Shell** says: “I’ll talk to the system libraries for you.”
4. **Library / API Layer** says: “Kernel, can you get this file?”
5. **Kernel (Boss Layer)** talks to **Hardware** (Disk, RAM, CPU) → gets the file → sends it back.
6. **Libraries & Shell** pass it back → **VSCode shows the file** → **You see it**.

✅ **Key idea:** The **Kernel sits in the middle**, controlling hardware, while apps, shells, and libraries **live above it**.
