# **Topic 15: IP Classes & CIDR – Detailed Yet Simple**

---

## **Step 1: What are IP Classes?**

IP addresses are like **house numbers** for computers on the Internet.
They are divided into **Classes A, B, C** to manage large, medium, and small networks.

Each class has:

1. **Network part** – identifies the network (city)
2. **Host part** – identifies devices (houses) in that network

---

### **Class A – Big Networks**

* **Range:** 1.0.0.0 → 126.255.255.255
* **First octet = network**, last 3 octets = hosts
* **Default Subnet Mask:** 255.0.0.0
* **Number of networks:** 128
* **Number of hosts per network:** 16,777,214

**Example:**

```
IP: 10.5.3.12
Network: 10
Host: 5.3.12
```

**Block Diagram:**

```
[Network: 10] | [Host: 5.3.12]
```

* Used for **very large organizations** with millions of devices.

---

### **Class B – Medium Networks**

* **Range:** 128.0.0.0 → 191.255.255.255
* **First 2 octets = network**, last 2 octets = hosts
* **Default Subnet Mask:** 255.255.0.0
* **Number of networks:** 16,384
* **Number of hosts per network:** 65,534

**Example:**

```
IP: 172.16.12.5
Network: 172.16
Host: 12.5
```

**Block Diagram:**

```
[Network: 172.16] | [Host: 12.5]
```

* Used for **medium organizations**, like universities or mid-size companies.

---

### **Class C – Small Networks**

* **Range:** 192.0.0.0 → 223.255.255.255
* **First 3 octets = network**, last octet = hosts
* **Default Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0
* **Number of networks:** 2,097,152
* **Number of hosts per network:** 254

**Example:**

```
IP: 192.168.1.10
Network: 192.168.1
Host: 10
```

**Block Diagram:**

```
[Network: 192.168.1] | [Host: 10]
```

* Used for **small offices or home networks**.

---

## **Step 2: What is CIDR?**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a **flexible way to divide networks** instead of sticking to fixed classes.

**Notation:** `IP / Prefix`

* **Prefix (/x)** = number of bits for network
* **Remaining bits** = hosts

---

### **Example 1: /24 (Small Network)**

```
IP: 192.168.1.0/24
```

* 24 bits = network
* 8 bits = hosts → 2^8 – 2 = 254 hosts

```
Network: 192.168.1.0
First Host: 192.168.1.1
Last Host: 192.168.1.254
Broadcast: 192.168.1.255
```

**Diagram:**

```
[Network: 192.168.1]
| 1 | 2 | 3 | … | 254 |
```

---

### **Example 2: /26 (Very Small Network)**

```
IP: 192.168.1.0/26
```

* 26 bits = network
* 6 bits = hosts → 2^6 – 2 = 62 hosts

```
Network: 192.168.1.0
Hosts: 1 – 62
Broadcast: 192.168.1.63
```

**Diagram:**

```
[Network: 192.168.1]
| 1 | 2 | … | 62 |
```

---

## ✅ **Key Points**

* **Class A:** Big networks → millions of devices
* **Class B:** Medium networks → tens of thousands of devices
* **Class C:** Small networks → hundreds of devices
* **CIDR:** Flexible, divide networks efficiently
