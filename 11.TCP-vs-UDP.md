## **Topic 11: TCP vs UDP (with SSE examples)**

### 🧒 Simple Meaning

**TCP and UDP** are two different ways computers **send data** to each other on the internet.

👉 Same job (sending data), **different styles**.

---

## 📞 Simple Story: Phone Call vs SMS

### **TCP = Phone Call 📞**

* You call your friend
* Friend says “Hello”
* You talk step by step
* If something is not heard, you **repeat it**

✔ Reliable
❌ Slower

📌 **SSE uses this style** (because SSE runs over HTTP → TCP)

---

### **UDP = SMS 💬**

* You send messages
* No confirmation if received
* Messages may come late or missing
* But they arrive **fast**

✔ Fast
❌ Not reliable

📌 **SSE does NOT use UDP**

## 🔹 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

### How TCP works (Simple):

1. Connection is made
2. Data is sent in order
3. Missing data is resent
4. Connection is closed

🧠 Like saying:

> “Did you hear me?” → “Yes” → “Okay continue”

### Used for:

* Websites (HTTP/HTTPS)
* Emails
* File downloads
* Banking apps
* **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** ✅

---

## 🔹 UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

### How UDP works (Simple):

1. Data is sent
2. No checking
3. No resending

🧠 Like saying:

> “I’m sending it, hope you get it!”

### Used for:

* Video streaming (YouTube, Netflix)
* Online games
* Voice calls (Zoom, WhatsApp)
* Live broadcasts

---

## 🌊 Where does SSE fit?

### **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**

* Uses **HTTP / HTTPS**
* Runs **on top of TCP**
* One-way communication: **Server → Client**
* Connection stays **open**

🧠 Simple idea:

> “Server keeps talking, client keeps listening.”

---

## 📦 SSE Example (Easy)

### Browser request:

```
GET /events HTTP/1.1
Accept: text/event-stream
```

### Server response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/event-stream
Connection: keep-alive
```

### Server keeps sending data:

```
data: New notification arrived
```

📌 Because SSE uses **TCP**, messages:

* Arrive **in order**
* Are **not lost**
* Are **re-sent if missing**

## 🆚 TCP vs UDP (Easy Table + SSE)

| Feature          | TCP                 | UDP          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Connection       | Yes                 | No           |
| Reliability      | High                | Low          |
| Speed            | Slower              | Faster       |
| Order guaranteed | Yes                 | No           |
| Resending data   | Yes                 | No           |
| Used for         | Web, email, **SSE** | Video, games |

## 🎯 Super Easy Memory Trick

> **TCP = Safe but slow 🐢 (SSE uses this)**
> **UDP = Fast but risky 🐇**

---

## 🧠 One-Line Summary (Interview Ready)

> TCP is a reliable, connection-based protocol used by HTTP and SSE, while UDP is a fast, connectionless protocol used for real-time streaming and gaming where speed matters more than reliability.
