## What is a Private IP address?

## Private IP 

- **Private IP is used inside a local network**
- **Private IP has no meaning on the internet**
- **Private IP cannot be routed on the internet**
- **NAT is used to translate private IP → public IP**
- **Only public IPs are valid on the internet**

### private IP ranges (RFC 1918)

```
10.0.0.0     – 10.255.255.255      (10.0.0.0/8)
172.16.0.0   – 172.31.255.255      (172.16.0.0/12)
192.168.0.0  – 192.168.255.255    (192.168.0.0/16)
```

### Public IP:

✅ ISPs **own and allocate** public IPs

✅ But **companies, cloud providers, data centers, offices** also *use* public IPs (assigned by ISPs)

Example:

* Our home router → public IP from ISP
* AWS EC2 → public IP from AWS (AWS got it from ISP/registry)
