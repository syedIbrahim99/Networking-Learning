### **Topic 1: What is HTTP?**

Imagine you want a **letter from a friend**. You write the letter and ask your friend to send you a reply.

* **You = Client (like your browser)**
* **Friend = Server (like the website)**
* **Letter = HTTP request**
* **Reply = HTTP response**

**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is like the **mail system** for the internet. It’s the rulebook that says **how your browser asks for a webpage** and **how the website sends it back**.

* When you type a website like `www.google.com` in your browser, your computer sends a “letter” (HTTP request) to Google’s server.
* The server reads your letter and sends back a “reply” (HTTP response) with the webpage.

**Example:**

* You type: `www.google.com` → Browser sends **HTTP request**
* Google server replies → Browser shows **Google homepage**

**Extra:**

* If you use **HTTPS**, it’s like sealing the letter in an **envelope** so no one else can read it.
