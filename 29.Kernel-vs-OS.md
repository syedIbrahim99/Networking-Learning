# Kernel and Operating System (OS) 

---

## 1️⃣ Kernel 

**Kernel:**

* Core part of the Operating System
* Manages hardware resources (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network)
* Provides services to user-space programs

### Explanation:

When a user or application does something:

* The request goes from the user/application layer to the kernel
* The kernel processes the request
* The kernel sends the response back

This processing and response is called a **kernel service**.

⚠️ If the kernel crashes → the **entire OS crashes**.

## 2️⃣ Operating System (OS) 

**Operating System:**

* A collection of software
* Manages hardware resources (using the kernel)
* Provides a platform for applications to run

### Explanation:

The OS is everything that helps users and applications use hardware **easily and safely**.

The OS does not manage hardware directly — it uses the **kernel** to do that.

## 3️⃣ Kernel vs Operating System (Clear Difference)

* **Kernel** is a part of the OS layer
* **Kernel talks directly to hardware**
* **OS includes kernel + libraries + shell/GUI + system tools**

So:

* Kernel = does the actual hardware work
* OS = complete system that makes the computer usable
