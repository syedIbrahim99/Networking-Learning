# IP Address – Simple Explanation

## What is an IP Address?

An **IP address** is a **unique address assigned to a device** on a network so that it can **send and receive data**.

---

## Need for an IP Address

An IP address is required to:

* **Identify** a device on a network
* **Send** data to another device
* **Receive** data from another device

👉 **Without an IP address, network communication is not possible.**

## Simple Example

When a user types **google.com** on a laptop:

1. The laptop creates a **request packet**
2. The packet contains:

   * **Source IP**: `192.168.1.10` (laptop’s IP)
   * **Destination IP**: Google server’s IP (resolved using DNS)
3. The request is sent through the internet
4. Google sends the response **back to the source IP (`192.168.1.10`)**

---

## Conclusion

An IP address is essential for **sending and receiving data** in a network.
Without an IP address:

* A device cannot be identified
* Communication between devices cannot happen

---

## Simple line

- An IP address is a unique address assigned to a device inside a network to send and receive data.

- Without IP address the device will be invisible in the network and network communication is not possible.
