## **1. What is an IPv4 address?**

An **IPv4 address** is a **unique 32-bit number** assigned to every device on a network (like your computer, phone, router) to **identify it** and allow it to communicate with other devices.

* IPv4 uses **32 bits** → divided into **4 groups of 8 bits** called **octets**.
* Each octet is written as a **decimal number** from **0 to 255**.
* Format: `X.X.X.X` → for example: `192.168.1.10`.

## **2. IPv4 Address Structure**

An IPv4 address has **two main parts**:

1. **Network ID** → identifies the network the device is on.
2. **Host ID** → identifies the device within that network.

Example:

```
IPv4 address: 192.168.1.10
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
```

* Network ID: `192.168.1` → all devices in this network have the same first 3 octets.
* Host ID: `10` → this is the unique device on the network.

**Subnet mask** helps the device know which part is network and which part is host.

## **3. Technical Example**

Let’s say you are in an office:

| Device  | IPv4 Address | Subnet Mask   |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Laptop  | 192.168.1.10 | 255.255.255.0 |
| Desktop | 192.168.1.11 | 255.255.255.0 |
| Printer | 192.168.1.20 | 255.255.255.0 |
| Router  | 192.168.1.1  | 255.255.255.0 |

* All devices share **192.168.1** → same network.
* Host part differs → `10, 11, 20, 1` → unique device identifiers.

Now, if your laptop `192.168.1.10` wants to send data to the printer `192.168.1.20`:

1. It checks the subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`.
2. Determines the printer is in the **same network**.
3. Sends the data directly via the router/switch inside the network.

### Conclusion

* IPv4 range: `0.0.0.0` → `255.255.255.255`.
* Total addresses: 2³² = 4,294,967,296 (~4.3 billion) (32-bit).
* ✅ 4,294,967,296 = 429 crore 49 lakh 67 thousand 296 
* Example of public IPv4: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).
* Example of private IPv4: `192.168.1.10` (used in homes/offices).
