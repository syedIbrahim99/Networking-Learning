## 🧩 Line-by-Line Explanation

### **1️⃣ Request Line**

```
POST /login HTTP/1.1
```

This line has **3 parts**:

#### 🟢 POST → HTTP Method

👉 What action you want to do

* `GET` = give me data
* `POST` = I am sending data

Here, **POST** means:

> “I am sending login details”

---

#### 🟢 /login → URL / Path

👉 Where you are sending the request

This means:

> “Send this request to the **login page**”

---

#### 🟢 HTTP/1.1 → HTTP Version

👉 Which rules to follow

This means:

> “Let’s talk using HTTP version 1.1 rules”

---

### **2️⃣ Headers Section**

Headers give **extra information** about the request.

---

#### 🟡 Host Header

```
Host: www.example.com
```

👉 Tells **which website/server** you are talking to

> “Hey, I am talking to example.com”

---

#### 🟡 User-Agent Header

---

### **4️⃣ Request Body**

```
username=syed&password=12345
```

👉 This is the **actual data** sent to the server
