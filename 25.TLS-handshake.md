### **SSL Handshake as Network Packet Calls**

1. **Client Hello Packet (Browser → Server)**

   ```
   Packet: Client Hello
   From: Browser
   To: Server
   Contents: 
     - Supported encryption methods (cipher suites)
     - Browser random number
   ```

   *Browser says:*
   “Hi Server! Here are the encryption methods I support and a random number to start encryption.”

2. **Server Hello + Certificate Packet (Server → Browser)**

   ```
   Packet: Server Hello + Certificate
   From: Server
   To: Browser
   Contents:
     - Chosen encryption method
     - Server random number
     - Server’s SSL certificate (identity)
   ```

   *Server says:*
   “Hi Browser! I choose this encryption method. Here’s my certificate to prove I’m real. Also, here’s my random number for key generation.”

3. **Certificate Verification (Browser checks server)**
   *Browser inspects the certificate to make sure the server is genuine.*

   ```
   Browser verifies:
     - Certificate signed by trusted CA
     - Matches server domain
   ```

4. **Client Key Exchange Packet (Browser → Server)**

   ```
   Packet: Client Key Exchange
   From: Browser
   To: Server
   Contents:
     - Pre-master secret (encrypted with server’s public key)
   ```

   *Browser says:*
   “Here’s a pre-master secret encrypted with your public key. Only you can decrypt it to generate the session key!”

5. **Server Finished Packet (Server → Browser)**

   ```
   Packet: Server Finished
   From: Server
   To: Browser
   Contents:
     - Verification that session keys match
   ```

   *Server says:*
   “I have decrypted the pre-master secret. Our session keys match. Ready to encrypt messages!”

6. **Client Finished Packet (Browser → Server)**

   ```
   Packet: Client Finished
   From: Browser
   To: Server
   Contents:
     - Verification of session key
   ```

   *Browser says:*
   “Session key verified. Let’s start sending encrypted data!”

Encrypted Communication Starts! (TLS/SSL)

**Algorithms used by SSL and TLS:**

***SSL***:

* RC4
* 3DES
* MD5
* SHA-1

***TLS***:
* AES
* ChaCha20
* SHA-256/384
* RSA/ECDHE

&#8658; SSL is deprecated and less secure.

&#8658; TLS is more secure and used for modern securtiy features.
