# **Topic 16: Ingress vs Egress Traffic – Super Simple**

---

## 🧒 Simple Meaning

* **Ingress = Incoming traffic → coming INTO your network**
* **Egress = Outgoing traffic → going OUT of your network**

Think of your **home network as a house**:

* People **entering your house** → Ingress
* People **leaving your house** → Egress

---

## 🏠 Real-Life Story

Imagine your house has a **front door**:

1. **Ingress Traffic (Visitors 🧑‍🤝‍🧑)**

   * Someone comes to visit → they enter your house
   * You **check if they are allowed in** (like a security guard)
   * Example: A friend coming to play, delivery person dropping a parcel

2. **Egress Traffic (Sending Things Out 📦)**

   * You send your things outside → they leave your house
   * You also check what you are sending
   * Example: Sending a letter, posting a parcel, or your kid going outside

> ✅ Network admins do the same thing with computers: check **incoming and outgoing traffic** for security.

## 🔹 Networking Example

* **Ingress Traffic:** Someone from the Internet tries to access your website → it comes **into your server**
* **Egress Traffic:** Your server sends a response → goes **out to the Internet**

## 🧱 Simple Block Diagram

       Internet
          |
       [Firewall]
          |
Inbound / Ingress  ---> [Your Network/Server] ---> Outbound / Egress
```

* **Firewall** monitors **both ingress and egress** traffic
* Protects from unwanted visitors and leaks
