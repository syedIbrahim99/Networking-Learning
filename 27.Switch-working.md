# SWITCH WORKING EXPLANATION:
# PC-A SENDS FILES TO PC-B THROUGH SWITCH (INTERNAL OFFICE NETWORK)

## 🏢 SETUP

* Devices:

  * PC-A
  * PC-B
  * PC-C (another PC)
  * Switch (Layer-2)

Topology:

```
PC-A ─┐
PC-B ─┼── Switch
PC-C ─┘
```

* All PCs are in the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.10.0/24)
* No router needed for internal communication

---

## 🔹 STEP 1: PC-A wants to send file to PC-B

PC-A checks:

> “I want to send data to PC-B”

PC-A knows the **IP of PC-B** (or wants to send to it) but **does not know the MAC address** yet.

---

## 🔹 STEP 2: PC-A makes an ARP request

PC-A broadcasts on the network:

```
Who has IP 192.168.10.11 (PC-B)? Tell me your MAC address
```

* This is called an **ARP request**
* Destination MAC = **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF (broadcast)**

---

## 🔹 STEP 3: Switch behavior (broadcast)

Switch receives the ARP request:

1. Reads **source MAC (PC-A)** and port → stores it in **MAC table**
2. Sees destination MAC = broadcast
3. **Floods the ARP request to all other ports except PC-A port**

> PC-B and PC-C both receive the request

---

## 🔹 STEP 4: PC-B replies

PC-B responds:

```
IP 192.168.10.11 is at MAC BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:BB
```

* This is a **unicast reply** sent directly to PC-A MAC

---

## 🔹 STEP 5: Switch forwards the reply

Switch receives PC-B’s reply:

1. Reads **source MAC (PC-B)** → stores port in MAC table
2. Reads **destination MAC (PC-A)** → forwards frame **only to PC-A’s port**

✅ Now MAC table is:

```
Port 1 → PC-A MAC
Port 2 → PC-B MAC
Port 3 → PC-C MAC
```

---

## 🔹 STEP 6: Data transfer begins

PC-A now sends the file to PC-B:

* Packet:

  ```
  Src MAC: PC-A
  Dst MAC: PC-B
  ```
* Switch looks up destination MAC → sends **only to PC-B port**

PC-C does not see the data. ✅ Efficient.

---

## 🔹 STEP 7: Summary of switch behavior

* Switch **learns MAC addresses** of devices
* Switch **forwards frames only to correct port** (unicasts)
* Switch **floods only unknown destinations or broadcasts**
* Switch **does not use IP addresses**

---

## 🔹 ADDITIONAL NOTES

* Today, **most home routers have a built-in switch** for LAN ports.
* Even without a router, **switch can handle internal communication** perfectly.
* Router is only needed when traffic needs to go **outside the network** (internet).

# 🧠 FLOW DIAGRAM (VISUAL)

```
PC-A  ---> Switch ---> PC-B
MAC: PC-A -> Switch -> PC-B MAC
ARP request broadcasted to all (PC-B, PC-C)
MAC table updated for efficient forwarding
```

---

✅ **Conclusion:**
Your understanding is **correct**. Switch is purely **MAC-based**, floods unknowns, forwards known MACs, and enables internal communication even without a router.
